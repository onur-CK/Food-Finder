# Get Hung ...
... for the lamb, the sheep or the whole herd.
In this terminal based game of classic Hangman, the player tries to guess a word letter by letter before running out of lives and being sent to the gallows.
This project was built with Python3 as the "Python's Essentials" Project (portfolio project 3) for Code Insitute.

## Planning
The following flowchart (created with [daigrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/)) visualizes the planning process for this application.
![Flowchart](assets/images/GetHungFlow1.1.png)
## Design
As this is simple terminal based application, the design process for the user interface was limited.
Different colour choices and bold text are used in order to highlight and categorise messages to the user.
For example, error messages and wrong guesses are displayed in red, as is the gallows graphics to signify a negative event.
The word itself is displayed green for every correct guess.
General information, such as already guessed letters, is either displayed in yellow or simply bold.
Emojis are used in the introduction and termination of the game (both won or lost) to make up for the general lack of images.
## UX
### Programm Goals
The goal of this programm is to provide the user with a simple, easy to understand and play game of hangman that can be played multiple times without the challenge being repeated.
### User Stories
**As a user I want to**
- be able to read an introduction when first loading the programm
- read the rules to the game in short and consice text
- choose a difficulty level
- know how many lives I start off with
- be informed if my data input is not valid and why
- see which letters I have already guessed
- see the word being displayed for every correct guess
- be informed how many lives I have left after a wrong guess
- see a graphic visualising my lost lives
- learn the word to be guessed after losing the game
- see the full word displayed after completing the game successfully
- know when the game is over (won or lost)
- be able to restart the game or not when after it's finished

**As a site administrator I want to**

- be able to make modifications to the game (see [future features](#possible-future-features))
- offer the user a short yet entertaining game

### Possible Future Features

**Typing effect**
- Will type out print statements in terminal letter by letter to mimic type writer effect
**Single display game progression**
- Game progression will show in terminal as progressively building a single display
- This will prevent a continues flow of output and down-scrolling
## Data Model
*Utilising Class and OOP*
For the sake of using Python ```class``` in this project I created the ```class Level``` which creates three different instances of ```Level```, according to the user choice of difficulty level.
```Level``` has a property of ```self.level```. Its ```decide_level``` method determines which skill level the will be plaid at, depending on the user input.
*Data Validation*
To make use of the ```try``` and ```except``` statements, I created the two functions ```validate_level``` and ```validate_letter```. Both functions raise a value error if data input by the user is not valid for each specific case. 
In the initial version invalid data was simply handled with a print statement in an ```else``` clause (which may have sufficed in the case of this simple application). But for the sake of writing industry compliant code, I decided to outsource data validation to a specific function that raises a proper error. 
## Testing
### Validator Testing
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript validation does not apply to this project. The template provided by Code Institute as provided to all students is assumed to be tested for the above.
No further change or manipulation of the template's default HTML, CSS and JavaScript files has been performed.
- Python Validator [PEP8](http://pep8online.com/)
    - **Error**: Line too long on 13 lines of code
    - **Solution**: Break up lines of code using ``` \ ```
    No further errors or warnings.
    ![PEP8 results](assets/images/pep8-final-result.JPG)
- Performance, Accessibility, SEO, Best Practices (Lighthouse Chrome DevTools)
    ![Lighthouse results](assets/images/lighthouse-results.JPG)
    As SEO was not an objective of this particular project, I chose to be content with a rating that is barely below 90. 
### Browser Testing
Ensuring all parts of the programm function as expected in all major browsers.
| Browser     | Layout      | Functionality |
| :---------: | :----------:| :-----------: |
| Chrome      | ✔          | ✔             |
| Edge        | ✔          | ✔             |
| Firefox     | ✔          | ✔             |
| Safari      | ✔          | ✔             |
| IE          |deprecated by Microsoft, not tested|
### Testing User Stories (Functionality)
| Expectation (As a user, I want to...)  | Result (As a user, I...)    |
| :---------------------------------: | :------------------------------:|
| be able to read an introduction when first loading the programm | see a quick game introduction print out on the screen when the programm loads |
| read the rules to the game in short and consice text | see the game rules explained clearly as part of the introduction |
| choose a difficulty level | can choose between 3 levels: easy, medium, hard |
| know how many lives I start off with | I am clearly informed that I start off with 10 lives |
| be informed if my data input is not valid and why | see an error message after I input invalid data, telling me what data type is required |
| see which letters I have already guessed | can see my already guessed letters listed out on screen |
| see the word being displayed for every correct guess | can see every correct letter being added to the word, spelling it out gradually |
| be informed how many lives I have left after a wrong guess | I am told how many remaining lives I have after a wrong guess |
| see a graphic visualising my lost lives | can see the gallows graphips building a section at a time for each wrong guess |
| learn the word to be guessed after losing the game | can read the word printed out on screen after I lost the game |
| see the full word displayed after completing the game successfully | can read the word fully spelled out after guessing it correctly |
| know when the game is over (won or lost) | can read a message telling me I either won or lost the game when the game terminates |
| be able to restart the game or not when after it's finished | can choose between a Y/N option to restart the game after finishing |

## Debugging

### Fixed Bugs
**Formatting**
To guarantee consistent line breaks, whitespaces and indentation, run.py and words.py were formatted using [Black Playground](https://black.vercel.app/)
**Word not displaying fully when game won**:
After entering the last letter of the fully guessed word, the last letter is not added to the word display. Therefore the finished word doesn't display properly.
*Solution*:
Run display_word function again when condition for game completion is met:
```
elif len(word_letters) == 0:
    display_word()
    print("🎉 Well done! You guessed the whole word 🎉")
```
### Unfixed Bugs
No unfixed bugs to date.
## Deployment
This project was deployed with Heroku using Code Institute's mock terminal as provided with the Python Essentials template.
To deploy:
- Clone or fork this public repository
- Create a Heroku account (if not already existing)
- Create a new app with Heroku
- In **Settings**, add 2 buildpacks:
    - ```Python```
    - ```NodeJS```
    
    Ensure the buildpacks are created in that order!
- Allowing Heroku access to GitHub, link the new app to the relevant repository
- Choose whether or not to enable **Automatic Deploys**. If enabled, the deployed app will update automatically with each push to GitHub
- Click **Deploy**

### Data
- **Word List**: 
    [This list](https://www.randomlists.com/data/words.json) was used as supplied by [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/594273/how-to-pick-a-random-english-word-from-a-list)
    Using MS Word I manually removed all words containing "-" to simplify the game functionality. Also, I adapted the spelling to UK English where it originally differed.
